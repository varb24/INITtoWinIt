            <p>I'm an FIU student with a deep passion for <br /> machine learning and software engineering. <br />I'm driven by a desire to create innovative <br />solutions that have a positive impact on <br />people's lives. My approach to software <br />engineering is unconventional and creative, <br />and I enjoy experimenting with different <br /> technologies to solve problems. I'm not <br />afraid to take risks and learn from my <br />mistakes, and I thrive in collaborative <br />environments where I can exchange ideas <br />and bring a vision to life.</p>
